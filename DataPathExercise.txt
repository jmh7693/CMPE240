MARIE - Data Path Exercise
__________________________________________________________________________________

1.a PC is passing the next address to the data location in the MAR
1.b the MAR is initializing this location in memory
1.c The currently-executing instruction from the IR is being run on the 
value being read from or intered into memory from the MBR
1.d microoperation executed at the end of every fetch cycle to prepare
for the next value being fetched
1.e puts up the input dialog box
1.f The data being inputted is held in the InREG to be read by
1.g The computation result of the value held in the InREG is
stored as data in the accumulator

2.a PC is passing the next address to the data location in the MAR
2.b the MAR is initializing this location in memory
2.c The currently-executing instruction from the IR is being run on the 
value being read from or intered into memory from the MBR
2.d microoperation executed at the end of every fetch cycle to prepare
for the next value being fetched
2.e The instruction (to store a value) is being read in from the IR
2.f Sending the values IR address in memory to be stored in the MAR
2.g The accumulator sends the new value to the MBR to hold the value being read
2.h This value being read from the MBR and its address in memory stored in the MAR

4.a PC is passing the next address to the data location in the MAR
4.b the MAR is initializing this location in memory
4.c The currently-executing instruction from the IR is being run on the 
value being read from or intered into memory from the MBR
4.d microoperation executed at the end of every fetch cycle to prepare
for the next value being fetched
4.e The instruction (to add a value) is being read in from the IR
4.f Sending the values IR address in memory to be stored in the MAR
4.g Loads the value stored at the address into the MBR
4.h add value in AC with MBR value and store it back into AC
